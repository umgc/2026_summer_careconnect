// Tests for NotificationService.
//
// Coverage strategy:
//   NotificationService uses WebSocketChannel which requires a live server.
//   The initialize() method is not called in these tests to avoid real connections.
//
//   Branches tested:
//     isConnected getter — false before initialize() is called.
//     channel getter — null before initialize() is called.
//     dispose() — sets isConnected to false and does not throw when channel is null.
