 * Exception thrown when a user attempts an action they are not authorized to perform.

 * - User lacks the required permission or role for the requested action

 * This should map to HTTP 403 Forbidden in REST API responses.
 * 
 * Differentiation:
 * - UnauthorizedException (403) = Authenticated but lacks permission
 * - AuthenticationException (401) = Not authenticated or invalid credentials
